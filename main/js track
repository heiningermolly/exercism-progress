//totally stuck on how to handle this...

//Elyses Looping Enchantments
//I liked looking up the top-voted solution and seeing the way they used the ? as a conditional operator, plus involving the use of boolean parameters in the code itself.

//Two-Fer
//I feel very cute and clever for remembering about default paramenters.

export const twoFer = (name = "you") => {
  return "One for " + name + ", one for me.";
};

//Pangram
//things learned: needed to change the string to an array for it to work with special characters

//Freelancer Rates
//things learned: LOL I am bad at math. Also learned about Math.floor and Math.ceil

//Annalyn's Infiltration
//things learned: don't be redundant with booleans. If a parameter is a boolean, don't "= true" with it in the code. Just list it or !it.
